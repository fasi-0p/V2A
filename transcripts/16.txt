0.0 --> 4.8  Hi, my name is Xavier and when I talk about cryptocurrencies, I often get comments saying
4.8 --> 10.6  that Bitcoin, Ethereum and others aren't worth anything. That people are just artificially
10.6 --> 16.2  creating its value. And you know what? That's actually true. I also hear that they're not
16.2 --> 22.5  real because it's only virtual money, not physical. And that's true as well. But in this video,
22.5 --> 27.6  I would like to put these into context. I'm not trying to convince you to buy crypto,
27.6 --> 32.6  just putting things into context. So let's start with the argument that cryptocurrencies
32.6 --> 37.8  only exist in the virtual world and that if all computers were wiped out, none would be left.
38.3 --> 43.4  That's undoubtedly true, but the same can be said for the currencies that we use in our day-to-day
43.4 --> 50.2  lives. Take the dollar for instance. There are about 14.4 trillion US dollars in existence,
50.2 --> 56.5  but only 1.7 trillion of those exist in a physical form, that is banknotes or coins.
56.5 --> 64.6  That is just 11%. The remaining 89% is just virtual money, stored as a number in the databases of
64.6 --> 71.3  financial institutions. So that makes our real money not so different from cryptocurrencies.
71.3 --> 75.4  The second thing I like to address is that people seem to be under the impression that
75.4 --> 81.4  paper money is worth something because it is backed by a commodity like gold. We call this the
81.4 --> 87.6  gold standard, a system in which a currency is tied to a certain amount of gold. And this has two
87.6 --> 94.5  implications. First of all, it fixes the value of a currency to the value of gold, which is considered
94.5 --> 100.3  to be a good thing because gold prices aren't very volatile. And secondly, the supply of your
100.3 --> 105.8  currency is now limited to the amount of gold you have. If you want to create more money,
105.8 --> 110.9  you have to acquire more gold. The gold standard was in use for quite some time,
110.9 --> 116.8  but the system was abandoned in 1971 when President Nixon decided to end the dollar's
116.8 --> 122.8  convertibility into gold. This meant that the value was no longer fixed to gold and the dollar was
122.8 --> 128.5  allowed to float. It also allowed the government to control the total supply of money by printing
128.5 --> 134.2  more whenever needed. This could be done to limit the impact of an economic crisis for instance.
134.2 --> 138.8  Other countries soon followed and the world switched over from the gold standard to what we
138.8 --> 145.8  call fiat money, a currency without intrinsic value. In fact, currencies only have value because
145.8 --> 151.0  governments have declared them to be legal tender and because we all believe that it has value.
151.6 --> 158.3  That's it. Our modern monetary system is only held upright by our belief that money is worth
158.3 --> 163.6  something. We are willing to go to work every day to get paid because we believe that someone else
163.6 --> 169.9  will exchange our hard-earned money for something else, save for buying food or renting a home.
169.9 --> 175.8  It's actually a self-fulfilling prophecy. We believe that our money has value and therefore it
175.8 --> 181.4  has. If we stop believing in the value of money or the government can no longer guarantee it,
181.4 --> 187.7  we see hyperinflation. The value of money drops and the prices of goods increase substantially.
188.2 --> 193.3  We've seen this a few times in history, for instance in Germany after the First World War.
193.8 --> 200.2  Prices of goods doubled every two days. At one point, people actually burned their money because
200.2 --> 206.2  it was cheaper than buying firewood. So if our money has no real value, we should all start buying
206.2 --> 212.9  gold, right? Well, we could take it one step further and ask ourselves, why is gold considered to be
212.9 --> 218.8  valuable? I mean sure, it's a shiny metal with interesting properties, but is that enough?
218.9 --> 224.7  Could we say that gold has no real value either? That we all just believe and agree that it does?
225.4 --> 230.2  Well, yeah, that's completely true. Throughout history, gold has been considered to be one of
230.2 --> 236.6  the most valuable materials out there, probably because of its unique look. But that's about it.
236.6 --> 241.6  The only thing that gold is going for it is that it's relatively rare and that it's crucial
241.6 --> 247.5  for certain industries like electronics. But other than that, gold is just like money.
247.5 --> 253.1  Worth something because we believe. Alright, time for a conclusion. People are right when they say
253.1 --> 258.8  that cryptocurrencies have no value and are worthless, but they're wrong to think that the euro,
258.8 --> 264.9  dollar or yen are any different. We created them and each of us is keeping the idea alive that
264.9 --> 270.4  they are valuable. So that was it for this video. I hope this brought some clarity to the topic.
